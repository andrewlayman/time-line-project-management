        TLSwapF

        This module is responsible for creating and managing the
        storage and location of pages of data.  It is a support module
        for the ExtStorage module.

        This one manages pages of data in a temporary disk file.

    MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 
    22-Dec-87   AJL - Added checking of the page numbers in the page headers
                      on read and write of buffers.
                    - Fixed the FindLRUUnused procedure to return a good value
                      in Oldest on return when a free buffer is found.
                    - Fixed a problem in which SetWrite no work.
    30-Dec-87   AJL - Changed the strategy for deallocating buffers when space
                      is low so that we deallocate in order of buffer address.  
                      This should create a contiguous gap quicker.
                    - Put phrases in the phrases file.
     3-Jan-88   AJL - SynchWrite all buffers on a LowMemoryNotice.
                    - Allow LowMemory notices during FindFreeBuffer.
     5-Jan-88   LAA - Use the procedure passed as context by a low memory
                      notice to determine how much memory to free up.  Also
                      fixed a problem with initialization of SwapVolume.
    11-Jan-88   AJL - Preallocate our minimum number of buffers so that later
                      program tests for sufficient memory will take these into
                      account.
    14-Jan-88   LAA - Converted the temporary file to a regular file, and
                      closed and reopened it each time it's extended.  This
                      is to prevent lost clusters if the program terminates
                      abnormally.
    21-Jan-88   AJL - With Roger's recent changes to overlays, we no longer
                      need to respond to overlay loading notices.
                    - If we need more memory, we will send out a low memory
                      notice.
    25-Jan-88   AJL - Give an error message if we cannot allocate our minimum
                      number of buffers on startup.
                    - Expanded the size of the SWAPVOL parameter allowed.
                    - Modified the shutdown page class proc so that it
                      doesn't attempt to close the file unless it was opened.
                    - Don't set the Initialized flag if we have no buffers.
                    - Improve the error checking on file reopen, and rearrange
                      the procedures to use a common procedure, OpenSwapingFile.
                    - Don't panic and synch write all buffers unless we are
                      down to only a few, as indicated by the global constant
                      ComfortBuffers. 
    29-Jan-88   LAA - Made string large enough to hold message in DoStartup.
     1-Feb-88   AJL - Changed ComfortBuffers to Minbuffers+2;
                    - Changed the NoticeLowMemory proc to distinguish between
                      BeforeActing step as a query on how much (non-contiguous)
                      space is available, vs AfterActing which is a request to
                      deallocate buffers.
    02-Feb-88   LAA - Changed for new Space exports.
    10-Feb-88   RSC - Changed the procedure which sends out notices to correctly
                      use AfterActing.  Using BeforeActing would increment our
                      procedure pointer, ruining the program.
                AJL - Correctly check that a buffer is allocated before replying 
                      that its size is available for deallocation.
    13-Feb-88   LAA - In NoticeLowMemory, add in allocated but unlocked pages.
    14-Feb-88   AJL - Use DisplayFileError in Complain, and add file name.
    22-Feb-88   RSC - set debugging toggles for production.
     2-Mar-88   AJL - Force a terminating "\" on the swapvolume parameter.
    06-Mar-88   LAA - Substituted HeapSpaceLeft for HeapAvailable so that
                      lots of low memory messages wouldn't come out just
                      because we tried to allocate a buffer, when not being
                      able to do so it really ok as far as the user is
                      concerned.
    08-Mar-88   AJL - Added support for a status record in PageClassStatus.
                    - On startup, check for sufficient EMS memory.  If there
                      is lots of EMS memory, don't even install this disk 
                      swapping.
    09-Mar-88   AJL - Don't use the GlobalFileIsNearlyFull flag.  Instead,
                      use Interlock.
                    - If no EMS present, respond as PageMedium in order to 
                      allow FlexStor to segregate pages.
    15-Mar-88   AJL - Added a new procedure, FindUnusedBuffer, that is used 
                      within FindLeastUnlocked and also FindFreeBuffer.  This
                      is to ensure that allocated buffers that do no contain
                      pages are used before new buffers get allocated.
                          A further space-saving technique would be to, on a
                      low memory notice, copy unlocked pages from higher addressed
                      buffers to lower addressed ones.  This has not been done.
    19-Jul-88   AJL - CheckSum every page on read or write.
    16-Aug-88   RSC - 1) Lower page size to 4096 bytes.
                      2) Use DOS for disk I/O, not Logitek.
     6-Sep-88   RSC - Extend file N blocks at a time.  This is valuable only
                      because we allocate 4K, not 8K chunks now.  Because of
                      this, the file is extended twice as often, with all
                      of the FAT update overhead.
    27-Oct-88   AJL - Expanded the documentation.
                    - Add an initial extent in pages that is created when
                      the file is first used.
     7-Nov-88   RSC - On disks with more than 35MB free, we were overflowing.
     7-Nov-88   AJL - When checking for the amount of space we could free up,
                      never go below the MinBuffers limit.
                    - Don't check disk free space on every status call.
                      Instead check the amount free whenever we create
                      a new page.  If other files are being written to the
                      same disk, this can delay our catching that the disk
                      is filling up.  However, it saves significant stack 
                      space in the XPageClassStatus procedure, which is 
                      sometimes called when stack space is low.
    18-Nov-88   AJL - Rather than a FatalError, display an Error message
                      if we get a disk read checksum error.  This is to
                      help tech support diagnostics.  Some people have
                      unreliable disks.  A side effect is that we will 
                      retry the read.  If the data was written correctly,
                      this will help.
                    - Reinstated checksumming.
                    - Checksumming is now controlled by a run time parameter.
                      SWAPVOL=(,N) turns it off.
    29-Nov-88   RSC - Put increments/decrements of Interlock around
                      OpenOurFile.  Also cleaned up other Interlocks around
                      Error() calls.  Added more reporting capabilities to
                      CheckLowOnSpace() to distinguish between File FULL,
                      File LOW, and BAD DISK.  Call CheckLowOnSpace() during
                      initialization to insure swapvol is ok.
    10-Jan-89   RSC - Change Storage to Space.
    22-Feb-89   AJL - Allow more than 256 pages.
                    - Changed initial disk allocation to 128K, additions in 
                      blocks of 16 pages.
     2-Mar-89   RSC - Changed parameters to "InstallNewProcedure".
     7-Mar-89   LAA   Changed ADDRESS to ADR in calls to InstallNewProcedure.
    25-Apr-89   RSC - OOPS!  In "WriteBuffer", "ok2" was not being set to TRUE,
                      meaning that occasionally the swap file is marked as
                      hideously unavailable.  On a SynchWrite, this is a
                      FatalError()!.  Reported by Telecom Canada.
     6/7/89     AJL - Be greeder for space, but decreasingly so.  Long periods
                      of buffer activity uninterrupted by other users requesting
                      memory will cause us to gradually increase our number of
                      buffers.
    6-Jul-89    KKC   Check existance of TLSwap.$$$ on the current directory.
                      If TLSwap.$$$ exists, modify the swap file name to a
                      non existing file name.
    10-Jul-89   KKC   Assemblerize GetSwapFileName so that it can be used
                      by TLDOS.
    01-Aug-89   KKC   Get SWAPVOL for swap file.
    09-Aug-89   KKC   Add copyright message.
    10-Aug-89   AJL  -Change the LRU method to use an AgedList to track
                      the age of buffers instead of a When clock.
                     -Improve LRU tracking by marking about half the
                      buffers as though they were not in memory as a
                      better way of tracking which are recently used.
                     -Add a version toggle that can turn on or off the
                      Agression tracking on buffers.
    11-Aug-89   AJL  -Fix the MarkProvisionalBuffers routine to
                      use a high water mark to reduce the number it marks
                      each time.
    14-Aug-89   AJL  -Correct the XCreatePage and XRetrieve page routines
                      so that they do not mark the page as swapped away
                      while it is still in use.
                     -Remove the compile options R- S- T-.
                     -Install an IdleProc into Kbio that will write dirty
                      buffers back to disk when waiting for KB input.  
    15-Aug-89   AJL  -Fix an error in MoveLower that could cause infinite
                      looping on a low-memory notice.
                     -During idle processing, or on a low memory notice,
                      try to move buffers to lower addresses in order to
                      reduce heap fragmentation.
    15-Aug-89   AJL  -The 1-Aug-89 change added a second call to get the 
                      SWAPVOL parameter, but it parsed and expanded it
                      differently than the code in the Startup proc.  I
                      have consolidated these. 
    12-Sep-89   AJL  -Added a THIRD Y/N parameter.  "N" disables idle
                      writes.
                     -WriteBuffer had been returning an error if the FileIsFull
                      flag was set.  Now, only return an error if there was actually
                      an error writing.
                     -Added more printer diagnostics, and delay opening the
                      printer until TLStart has configured the printer.
    25-Sep-89   LAA  -Return a status of BAD when interlocked.  This will
                      allow Rugs to still get space for a rug even when we're
                      low on space, but not when we're interlocked.
    13-Oct-89   RSC  -Low memory notice processing would call MoveLower(),
                      which could call low memory notices.  Made MoveLower()
                      less aggressive, only making new buffers if there is
                      existing free memory, not if memory COULD be made free.

                      Problem still outstanding: This overlay does not track
                            free space WITHIN buffers, so returns queazy
                            when the disk is full, even if buffers have
                            been discarded or are empty.

    23-Oct-89   RSC  -Added tracking of deleted pages, so we can determine

                      FlexSpaceAvailable = DiskSpaceAvailable + FreePages

                      This is to address the problem mentioned in my comment
                      of 13-Oct-89, and in bug report #1545.

                      This is done by monitoring the "DiscardPage" calls
                      from FlexStor.  We used to return FALSE, meaning
                      "I can't discard this.  Don't you either".

    23-Oct-89   AJL  -Make sure that XRetrievePage doesn't allow 
                      MarkProvisionalBuffers to mark the page being retrieved
                      as absent.
     4-Dec-89   RSC  -Add explicit 4th parameter to SWAPVOL=() to determine
                      if we should exit when there is enough EMS.  Set the
                      amount of EMS we need to be a little smaller.
     5-Dec-89   AJL  -Fix a coding error in the above change.
                     -Document the run-line parameters.
    14-Jun-90   RSC  -Fixed bug where we wrote to the disk 3 times for every
                      expected write.  Also upped the vpages from 512 to
                      1024.  Look for the "14-Jun-90"
     3-Oct-90   DSL  -Changed all "$"'s to "%"'s in filenames for Unix 
                      compatability
    23-Oct-90   RSC   Changed %'s to 4's in filenames for Dos batch.
     9-Nov-90   TGS   Integrate changes made to 4.03.
     1-Jan-90   AJL  -In conjunction with my (experimental) changes to 
                      FlexStor which keep locked records on the heap, I
                      have reduced the minimum number of buffers to 1!
                     -Change PageSize to 8K because of their increased
                      internal overhead.

  (* -------------------- Module Aging ---------------------- *)


  (* This module manages a queue of buffer numbers.  It can add
     numbers to the end of the queue, remove numbers from the 
     queue, and find numbers based on their age in the queue. 

     We use it to keep the records so that we know which buffers are
     the least recently used.

     We are using this within a scheme invented by someone at Borland and
     described in the Turbo Pascal manual in the section on overlays.
     Briefly, we want to improve the accuracy of the tracking of the 
     least-recently-used buffer, so periodically tell FlexStor that the 
     oldest group of buffers have been swapped out, even though they 
     haven't been.  Those that FlexStor asks to be mapped in before they
     actually get swapped out are put at the end of the queue, as young
     buffers.

     The cost is the overhead of marking buffers as out, plus the work
     of doing an XRetrievePage more often.  The benefit is fewer disk
     reads.
